# Prework Study Guide

## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- What was your motivation? 
Creating this project, I learned about the fundamentals of coding and started to dabble into the basics of the main programming languages. My start to becoming a software engineer/web developer!

- Why did you build this project? 
Not because it was homework, but because I am interested in learning about coding and web development.

- What problem does it solve? 
No problem is solved but it gives me a little insight before I start the main course, bootcamp.

- What did you learn? 
The mindset of a coder is extremely important. Thankfully, I am a very logical thinker, not like a computer but I am able to think in a conventional way that a web developer would. Still working on it of course!
